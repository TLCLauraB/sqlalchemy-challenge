# Homework Repo for Challenge 10

## Overview

I received help and support from my fellow Data Vis classmates via our Discord Server as well as our class-provided Slack Channel. I regularly attend both before- and after-class Office Hours to engage the materials with the Instructor and TAs.

I rewatched several of the classes from Module 10 using the Zoom recordings found at BSC > Zoom > Cloud Recordings. In conjunction with that, I re-reviewed the Module 10 Instructor Demos provided through GitLab.

In trying to debug the 'Pandas Plotting with Matplotlib' plot, both Sam Schultz and Lan 'Alice' Nguyen helped me. Or tried. My table still doesn't make sense and I'm not sure why.

Katy Yelle suggested reducing the number of plot ticks using pyplot.locator_params, but that also did not work. 

I struggled with this assignment.

I utilized the following resources:
